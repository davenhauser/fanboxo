##About Fanboxo
Fanboxo is a monthly subscription service delivering 3 to 5 officially licensed products for your favorite team, curated arount a theme, every month.

##Vision

Our goal was to deploy the fanboxo website to [www.fanboxo.com](www.fanboxo.com), acquired through **DreamHost**, and start accepting orders.
Unfortunately, during the development phase, we ran into a series of issues, which due to limited time prevented us from having a totally functional and finished website.

##The Journey

We started the fanboxo project using **Ruby on Rails** and **Shopify**. We set up a very basic Shopify App and deployed it to Heroku. This initial phase can be seen under [fanboxo.herokuapp.com](https://fanboxo.herokuapp.com/login) and the GitHub Repository for it can be found [here](https://github.com/davenhauser/fanboxo_app).

We then  switched to **Node.js** because using **Angular.js** with its **ui-Router**  allowed us to set up a SPA (single-page application) in less time. 


Currently the **CSS** and **HTML** for the Homepage and Giftpage can be viewed and accessed [here](https://github.com/davenhauser/fanboxo).

Next to Shopify we tried to implement checkout and shipping functionalities to this web-application using open-source platforms such as [SimpleCart](http://simplecartjs.org/) and [Flatmarket](https://github.com/christophercliff/flatmarket). None could be implemented to a satisfactory degree in the time given.

A new deployment to Heroku failed, possibly because of the lack of a database in the back end of the application.
