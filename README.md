##About Fanboxo
Fanboxo is a monthly subscription service delivering 3 to 5 officially licensed products for your favorite team, curated arount a theme, every month.

##Goal

Our goal was to deploy the fanboxo website to [www.fanboxo.com](www.fanboxo.com), acquired through **DreamHost**, and start accepting orders.
Unfortunately, during the development phase, we ran into a series of issues, which due to limited time prevented us from having a totally functional and finished website.

##The Journey

We started the fanboxo project using **Ruby on Rails** and **Shopify**. We set up a very basic Shopify App and deployed it to Heroku. This initial phase can be seen under [fanboxo.herokuapp.com](https://fanboxo.herokuapp.com/login) and the GitHub Repository for it can be found [here](http://i.imgur.com/9mkBlTE.jpg).

We then  switched to **Node.js** because using **Angular.js** with its **ui-Router**  allowed us to set up a SPA (single-page application) in less time. 


Currently the **CSS** and **HTML** for the Homepage and Giftpage can be viewed and accessed [here](http://i.imgur.com/dg4i3Ew.jpg).

Next to Shopify we tried to implement checkout and shipping functionalities to this web-application using open-source platforms such as [SimpleCart](http://simplecartjs.org/) and [Flatmarket](https://github.com/christophercliff/flatmarket). None could be implemented to a satisfactory degree in the time given.

A new deployment to Heroku failed, possibly because of the lack of a database in the back end of the application.

##Technologies & services used and taken into consideration

- Ruby on Rails
- MongoDB | Express | Angular.js | Node.js
- HTML5 | CSS3 | JavaScript
- Heroku
- Shopify
- Stripe
- SimpleCart
- Flatmarket
- Wordpress
- HTML5 UP

##Future Steps
 
[ ] Create About Page.  
[ ] Implement Shopify for checkout and shipping.  
[ ] Deploy app and make accessible through www.fanboxo.com.
